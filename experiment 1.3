Experiment 1.3 : Write a Java program to create an Employee class where an Overloaded constructor initializes employee details.
The default constructor should Initialize name as "Unknown" and salary as 0 and the second constructor initializes the name and sets a default salary.  
Create a method DisplayEmployeeDetails() to display employee information.

Program:
class Employee {
    private String name;
    private double salary;
    public Employee() {
        this.name = "ABC";
        this.salary = 0.0;
    }

    public Employee(String name) {
        this.name = name;
        this.salary = 30000.0; 
    }

    public void displayEmployeeDetails() {
        System.out.println("Employee Name: " + name);
        System.out.println("Employee Salary: $" + salary);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
      
        Employee emp1 = new Employee();
        emp1.displayEmployeeDetails();

        System.out.println(); 

        Employee emp2 = new Employee("Garima");
        emp2.displayEmployeeDetails();
    }
} 
//OUTPUT: 
Employee Name: ABC
Employee Salary: $0.0

Employee Name: Garima
Employee Salary: $30000.0
